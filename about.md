Hi! I am Giovanni and I am currently a third year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I am currently double majoring in Computer Science and in Mathematics. These days I am mostly interested in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. My interests in Mathematics vary largely and I have not really settled on any area of mathematics that I am particularily interested in at the moment. That said, some of my favourite topics that I am exploring at the moment are Logic and Set Theory, Cellular Automaton, Number Theory, and Computability and Complexity Theory. 


This blog is going to serve as a way for me to ramble about my adventures through my undergraduate degree including whatever topics I am interested in at the moment, overviews of courses I've taken, and in general a way to document my journey in mathematics.

If you'd like to reach me you can always email me at giovanni.tedesco@mail.utoronto.ca.

Happy Reading,

Giovanni
